# Simple Interest Calculator

## Description
This project is a Simple Interest (SI) Calculator that calculates simple interest using the formula:
Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100
## Formula
SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest
- T = Time (in years)

## Example
If:
- Principal = 1000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

## Technologies Used
- Basic programming logic
